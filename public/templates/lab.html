<!--

  IMPORTANT) This template actually lives in:

    * /server/HTML/lab-templates.coffee   (Handlebars templates)
    * /server/HTML/lab.coffee             (Javascript page assembler)

  The lab page template is generated from a JSON notebook description by the server.
  Angular could probably do this itself but having it on the server means better caching,
  and it cuts out a round trip (the client no longer needs to do an API request).
